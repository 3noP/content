description: 'Amazon DynamoDB Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service
  that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB
  lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed
  database, so that you don''t have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and
  configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With DynamoDB,
  you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and
  serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables''
  throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS
  Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. DynamoDB
  automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number
  of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining
  consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks
  (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS
  region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. '

        \ an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. \n\t +\
        \  To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name\
        \ in an expression. \n\t +  To prevent special characters in an attribute\
        \ name from being misinterpreted in an expression. \n\t  Use the **#** character\

        \ the following attribute name: \n\t +   Percentile  \n\t  The name of this\

        \ in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved\
        \ Words in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*). To work around this, you\
        \ could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames: \n\t +   {\"#P\"\

        \ as in this example: \n\t +   #P = :val  \n\t   Tokens that begin with the\

        \ These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document.\

    description: The BatchGetItem operation returns the attributes of one or more
      items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key.
      A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many
      as 100 items. BatchGetItem returns a partial result if the response size limit
      is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal
      processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns
      a value for UnprocessedKeys. You can use this value to retry the operation starting
      with the next item to get.  If you request more than 100 items, BatchGetItem
      returns a ValidationException with the message "Too many items requested for
      the BatchGetItem call."  For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but
      each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not
      to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate UnprocessedKeys value
      so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include
      its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset. If *none* of
      the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all
      of the tables in the request, then BatchGetItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException.
      If *at least one* of the items is successfully processed, then BatchGetItem
      completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in UnprocessedKeys.  If
      DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation
      on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential
      backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying
      read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables.
      If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests
      in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch
      Operations and Error Handling in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.  By
      default, BatchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads on every table in
      the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead
      to true for any or all tables. In order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem
      retrieves items in parallel. When designing your application, keep in mind that
      DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response
      by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the
      ProjectionExpression parameter. If a requested item does not exist, it is not
      returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read
      capacity units according to the type of read. For more information, see Working
      with Tables in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

      \ all items have been processed. If *none* of the items can be processed due\

      \ see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer\
      \ Guide*.  With BatchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts\
      \ of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into\
      \ DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations,\
      \ BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as individual PutItem and DeleteItem\
      \ calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put\
      \ and delete requests, and BatchWriteItem does not return deleted items in the\
      \ response. If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you\
      \ can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include\
      \ the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support\
      \ threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In\
      \ both situations, BatchWriteItem performs the specified put and delete operations\
      \ in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having\
      \ to introduce complexity into your application. Parallel processing reduces\
      \ latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number\
      \ of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete\
      \ operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit. If one or\
      \ more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:\
      \  *  One or more tables specified in the BatchWriteItem request does not exist.\
      \ \n *  Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match\
      \ those in the corresponding table's primary key schema. \n *  You try to perform\
      \ multiple operations on the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request. For\
      \ example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same BatchWriteItem\
      \ request.  \n *   Your request contains at least two items with identical hash\
      \ and range keys (which essentially is two put operations).  \n *  There are\
      \ more than 25 requests in the batch. \n *  Any individual item in a batch exceeds\
      \ 400 KB. \n *  The total request size exceeds 16 MB. \n "

      \ before you hit a limit. For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to\

      \ your current account limits on provisioned capacity there. \n 4.  Create a\
      \ variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your\
      \ tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units.\
      \ Zero them both. \n 6.  Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB\
      \ tables. \n 8.  For each table name listed by ListTables, do the following:\
      \ \n\t *  Call DescribeTable with the table name. \n\t *  Use the data returned\
      \ by DescribeTable to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned\
      \ for the table itself to your variables. \n\t *  If the table has one or more\
      \ global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned\
      \ capacity values to your variables as well. \n\t  \n 10.  Report the account\
      \ limits for that Region returned by DescribeLimits, along with the total current\
      \ provisioned capacity levels you have calculated. \n  This will let you see\
      \ whether you are getting close to your account-level limits. The per-table\

      \ of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary\
      \ indexes. For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase\
      \ provisioned capacity extremely rapidly. But the only upper limit that applies\

        \ the condition for the sort key. Following is an example, using the **=**\
        \ comparison operator for the sort key:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval\
        \ AND sortKeyName = :sortkeyval  Valid comparisons for the sort key condition\
        \ are as follows:  *   sortKeyName = :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value\
        \ is equal to :sortkeyval. \n *   sortKeyName < :sortkeyval - true if the\
        \ sort key value is less than :sortkeyval. \n *   sortKeyName <= :sortkeyval\
        \ - true if the sort key value is less than or equal to :sortkeyval. \n *\
        \   sortKeyName > :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than\
        \ :sortkeyval. \n *   sortKeyName >=  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value\
        \ is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval. \n *   sortKeyName BETWEEN :sortkeyval1\
        \ AND :sortkeyval2 - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to\
        \ :sortkeyval1, and less than or equal to :sortkeyval2. \n *   begins\\_with\
        \ ( sortKeyName, :sortkeyval ) - true if the sort key value begins with a\
        \ particular operand. (You cannot use this function with a sort key that is\
        \ of type Number.) Note that the function name begins\\_with is case-sensitive.\
        \ \n  Use the ExpressionAttributeValues parameter to replace tokens such as\
        \ :partitionval and :sortval with actual values at runtime. You can optionally\
        \ use the ExpressionAttributeNames parameter to replace the names of the partition\
        \ key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary\
        \ if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example,\
        \ the following KeyConditionExpression parameter causes an error because *Size*\
        \ is a reserved word:  *   Size = :myval  \n  To work around this, define\
        \ a placeholder (such a #S) to represent the attribute name *Size*. KeyConditionExpression\
        \ then is as follows:  *   #S = :myval  \n  For a list of reserved words,\
        \ see Reserved Words in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*. For more information\

    description: The Query operation finds items based on primary key values. You
      can query any table or secondary index that has a composite primary key (a partition
      key and a sort key).  Use the KeyConditionExpression parameter to provide a
      specific value for the partition key. The Query operation will return all of
      the items from the table or index with that partition key value. You can optionally
      narrow the scope of the Query operation by specifying a sort key value and a
      comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression. To further refine the Query results,
      you can optionally provide a FilterExpression. A FilterExpression determines
      which items within the results should be returned to you. All of the other results
      are discarded.   A Query operation always returns a result set. If no matching
      items are found, the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results
      consume the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read operation.    DynamoDB
      calculates the number of read capacity units consumed based on item size, not
      on the amount of data that is returned to an application. The number of capacity
      units consumed will be the same whether you request all of the attributes (the
      default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection expression). The
      number will also be the same whether or not you use a FilterExpression.    Query
      results are always sorted by the sort key value. If the data type of the sort
      key is Number, the results are returned in numeric order; otherwise, the results
      are returned in order of UTF-8 bytes. By default, the sort order is ascending.
      To reverse the order, set the ScanIndexForward parameter to false.   A single
      Query operation will read up to the maximum number of items set (if using the
      Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering to
      the results using FilterExpression. If LastEvaluatedKey is present in the response,
      you will need to paginate the result set. For more information, see Paginating
      the Results in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.   FilterExpression is
      applied after a Query finishes, but before the results are returned. A FilterExpression
      cannot contain partition key or sort key attributes. You need to specify those
      attributes in the KeyConditionExpression.    A Query operation can return an
      empty result set and a LastEvaluatedKey if all the items read for the page of
      results are filtered out.   You can query a table, a local secondary index,
      or a global secondary index. For a query on a table or on a local secondary
      index, you can set the ConsistentRead parameter to true and obtain a strongly
      consistent result. Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads
      only, so do not specify ConsistentRead when querying a global secondary index.

    description: The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes

      fewer items, you can provide a FilterExpression operation. If the total number
      of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops
      and results are returned to the user as a LastEvaluatedKey value to continue
      the scan in a subsequent operation. The results also include the number of items
      exceeding the limit. A scan can result in no table data meeting the filter criteria.  A
      single Scan operation reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using
      the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering
      to the results using FilterExpression. If LastEvaluatedKey is present in the
      response, you need to paginate the result set. For more information, see Paginating
      the Results in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.   Scan operations proceed
      sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary
      index, applications can request a parallel Scan operation by providing the Segment
      and TotalSegments parameters. For more information, see Parallel Scan in the
      *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.  Scan uses eventually consistent reads when
      accessing the data in a table; therefore, the result set might not include the
      changes to data in the table immediately before the operation began. If you
      need a consistent copy of the data, as of the time that the Scan begins, you
      can set the ConsistentRead parameter to true.

        \ or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: SET myNum\
        \ = myNum + :val   SET supports the following functions: \n\t +   if\\_not\\\
        _exists (path, operand) - if the item does not contain an attribute at the\
        \ specified path, then if\\_not\\_exists evaluates to operand; otherwise,\
        \ it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an\
        \ attribute that may already be present in the item. \n\t +   list\\_append\
        \ (operand, operand) - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it.\
        \ You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing\
        \ the order of the operands. \n\t  These function names are case-sensitive.\
        \ \n *   REMOVE - Removes one or more attributes from an item. \n *   ADD\
        \ - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already\
        \ exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on\
        \ the data type of the attribute: \n\t +  If the existing attribute is a number,\
        \ and if Value is also a number, then Value is mathematically added to the\
        \ existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted\
        \ from the existing attribute.  If you use ADD to increment or decrement a\
        \ number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB\
        \ uses 0 as the initial value. Similarly, if you use ADD for an existing item\
        \ to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the\
        \ update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. For example, suppose that\
        \ the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named itemcount, but\
        \ you decide to ADD the number 3 to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create\
        \ the itemcount attribute, set its initial value to 0, and finally add 3 to\
        \ it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute in the item, with a value\
        \ of 3.  \n\t +  If the existing data type is a set and if Value is also a\
        \ set, then Value is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute\
        \ value is the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final\
        \ attribute value is [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an ADD action is specified\
        \ for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the\
        \ existing set type.  Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For\
        \ example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also\
        \ be a set of strings. \n\t   The ADD action only supports Number and set\
        \ data types. In addition, ADD can only be used on top-level attributes, not\
        \ nested attributes.  \n *   DELETE - Deletes an element from a set. If a\
        \ set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old\
        \ set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE\
        \ action specifies [a,c], then the final attribute value is [b]. Specifying\
        \ an empty set is an error.  The DELETE action only supports set data types.\
        \ In addition, DELETE can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested\
        \ attributes.  \n  You can have many actions in a single expression, such\
        \ as the following: SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5\

      one hour duration result in a ValidationException.  TTL compares the current
      time in epoch time format to the time stored in the TTL attribute of an item.
      If the epoch time value stored in the attribute is less than the current time,
      the item is marked as expired and subsequently deleted.   The epoch time format
      is the number of seconds elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.   DynamoDB
      deletes expired items on a best-effort basis to ensure availability of throughput
      for other data operations.   DynamoDB typically deletes expired items within
      two days of expiration. The exact duration within which an item gets deleted
      after expiration is specific to the nature of the workload. Items that have
      expired and not been deleted will still show up in reads, queries, and scans.  As
      items are deleted, they are removed from any local secondary index and global
      secondary index immediately in the same eventually consistent way as a standard
      delete operation. For more information, see Time To Live in the Amazon DynamoDB
      Developer Guide. '
